The investigation focuses on the CO~2~ emissions from pesticides, packaging, retail, transportation, industrial processes and product use. The question this investigation is trying to answer is: Do the added on \"ingredients\", such as pesticides, industrial processes, packaging and food retail including transportation, contribute significantly to CO~2~ emissions?\n\nThis question is important to me to answer because I have a strong interest in our food processes and consumption habits. Much of the produce and food processed and not sold at retail stores are thrown away. Impurities and imperfections on produce can deem them unfit for the retail market, and then they are disposed of. We must acknowledge the processes that is being used to processes and grow these food and the emissions that is being developed by them. In a capitalist society, disposal of fresh usable produces has become normal. We must be be conscious of our spending habits, processing habits, and just how much resources we use subconsciously.\n\nI predict that these added-on \"ingredients\" to our produce and agriculture processes, do significantly add to the produced CO~2~ emissions from agricultural sites. Everything from pesticides, washing, packaging, processing, and disposal of \"unfit\" produce can and will add on the CO~2~ emissions. Food retail, transportation and disposal do add on to the emissions as well.\n\n# Methods\n\n### Data source\n\nMy data source is from Kaggle.com, \"Agri-food CO2 emission dataset - Forecasting ML\" by Alessandro Lo Bello.\n\n-   data set: <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessandrolobello/agri-food-co2-emission-dataset-forecasting-ml>\n\n### Packages used\n\nI used theses packages in my approach:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tibble    3.3.0\n✔ purrr     1.1.0     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (<http://conflicted.r-lib.org/>) to force all conflicts to become errors\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Approach\n\n-   Data set - Give more details about the data set:\n\n    -   What is the source?\n\n        The source was constructed by merging dozens of data sets from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (Bello, 2023).\n\n    -   How was the data collected?\n\n        The data was collected from a dozen individual data sets from the FAO and IPCC. They were cleaned, preprocessed, and merged together to create a \"comprehensive and cohesive\" data set (Bello, 2023).\n\n    -   What are the variables included?\n\n        savanna fires, forest fires, crop residues, rice cultivation, drained organic soils ( co2), pesticides manufacturing, food transport, forestland, net forest conversion, food household consumption, food retail, on-farm electricity use, food packaging, agrifood systems waste disposal, food processing, fertilizers manufacturing, ippu (Emissions from industrial processes and product use), manure applied to soils, manure management, fires in organic soils, fires in humid tropical forests, on-farm energy use, rural population, total population, total population - male, total population - female.\n\n    -   how many records/rows/participants?\n\n        236 unique geographical areaa.\n\n    -   Any other relevant information\n\n        -   DATA IS RECORDED IN KILOTONES (kt) 1 kt = 1000 kg\n\n-   Tools\n\n    -   R and RStudio in Posit.Cloud\n\n    -   GitHub\n\n    # Predictions\n\n    -   How, specifically, will you assess your question(s)? Take your general questions and rephrase them based on the variables in your dataset (*e.g.* *I will examine the correlation between aggregated-stress scores and the subjective-well-being scale*).\n\n        I will examine the correlation between co2 emissions and the emission contributions from three factors, pesticides, industrial processes, packaging and food retail\n\n    -   Repeat your predictions, but with more specificity (e.g. *I predict that residents will have at least 1 point higher median score on the subjective-well being score than commuters*).\n\n    -   I predict that packaging and food retail will have more co2 emissions than, pesticides\n\n# Results\n\n-   Code - Show the code block you are using to:\n\n    -   Retrieve/load the data\n\n    -   Conduct any clean up or transformations\n\n    -   Visualize the data\n\n-   A key figure, well-labelled, with a clear caption, presenting the data visualization you will use to answer your research question. In most cases, you would have 1 figure per question.\n\n-   A simple 1-sentence conclusion. Don’t refer to your prediction – just give a clear, concise, specific conclusion from what you can observe in your figure\n\n1\\) As food was processed in some areas, the total emission were most likely to increase as well\n\n2\\) There is a slight positive correlation between the manufactured pesticides used on the farms and the total co2 emissions it contirbutes to\n\n3\\) there is a strong positive correlation between the industrial processes and product use emissions and the total emissions that a region develops.\n\n# Discussion\n\n-   Was your hypothesis supported, undermined, or no determination?\n\n    -   my hypothesis was supported (1), food processing emissions do contribute strongly and somewhat significantly to a region's total co2 emissions\n\n        my hypothesis was undermined , a bit,(2), pesticides do not contribute strongly to the co2 emissions that a region contributes total, it still contributes somewhat to the total emissions, but there is many regions that hardly use pesticides and their contribution is close to none, there are also some regions that pesticides contribute\n\n        my hypothesis was supported (3), industrial processes and product use emissions contribute strongly to the co2 emissions that a region contributes total\n\n    -   How have you updated your beliefs, and why?\n\n        -   Believe in your hypothesis more?\n\n        -   Believe in your hypothesis less?\n\n        -   No change in your belief in your hypothesis, instead a change in your belief that the way you tried to answer the question is valid\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfoodAgro <- read.csv(\"Agrofood_co2_emission.csv\")\n\nfoodAgro2 <- foodAgro |>\n  group_by(Area) |> \n  summarise(Year, \n      Area,\n      total_emission, \n      Pesticides.Manufacturing, \n      IPPU, Food.Transport, \n      Food.Retail, \n      Food.Processing, \n      Food.Packaging) |>\n  mutate(food.ready.emissions = \n          Food.Transport \n        + Food.Retail\n        + Food.Packaging \n        + Food.Processing)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: Returning more (or less) than 1 row per `summarise()` group was deprecated in\ndplyr 1.1.0.\nℹ Please use `reframe()` instead.\nℹ When switching from `summarise()` to `reframe()`, remember that `reframe()`\n  always returns an ungrouped data frame and adjust accordingly.\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'Area'.
