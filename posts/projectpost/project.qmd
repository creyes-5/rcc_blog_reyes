# Introduction

data set: <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessandrolobello/agri-food-co2-emission-dataset-forecasting-ml>

-   What are your questions and why are they important to you? At this stage, the questions should be fairly general (Does production quantity predict pricing? Does happiness relate to stress levels?)

    "do the added on 'ingredients', such as pesticides, industrial processes, packaging and food retail, contribute significantly to co2 emissions

    does the production of co2 pesticides contribute overall to the contribution of co2 in the environment

    these questions are important to me because i have always been interested in our food processes and consumption habits. How is it many people are actively and unknowingly throwing away their food and it has become a comodity while other poeple are barely able to find a decent meal to live off of.

-   Predictions: Give your prediction for your question. The question is still general, but the prediction should have some specificity about direction (positive or negative relationship?) and magnitude (subtle, moderate, large). For example: *I predict that students who live on campus will report substantially more happiness than those who commute*.

-   I predit that these "added on" processes do significantly add to the co2 emissions. think about washing pacakging, making the packaging, and disposal of "unfit food"

-   What is the data source you will use to help you answer your question(s?). You don’t need details yet.

-   Approach

    -   Data set - Give more details about the data set:

        -   What is the source?

            the source is from the food and agriculture organization (FAO), and the intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC)

        -   How was the data collected?

            the data was collected from a dozen individual data sets from the FAO and IPCC.

        -   What are the variables included?

            savanna fires, forest fires, crop residues, rice cultivation, drained organic soils ( co2), pesticides manufacturing, food transport, forestland, net forest conversion, food household consumption, food retail, on-farm electricity use, food packaging, agrifood systems waste disposal, food processing, fertilizers manufacturing, ippu (Emissions from industrial processes and product use), manure applied to soils, manure management, fires in organic soils, fires in humid tropical forests, on-farm energy use, rural population, total population, total population - male, total population - female.

        -   how many records/rows/participants?

            236 unique geografical area.

        -   Any other relevant information

    -   Tools

        -   R and RStudio in Posit.Cloud

        -   GitHub

    -   Approach/Predictions

        -   How, specifically, will you assess your question(s)? Take your general questions and rephrase them based on the variables in your dataset (*e.g.* *I will examine the correlation between aggregated-stress scores and the subjective-well-being scale*).

        -   Repeat your predictions, but with more specificity (e.g. *I predict that residents will have at least 1 point higher median score on the subjective-well being score than commuters*).

-   Results

    -   Code - Show the code block you are using to:

        -   Retrieve/load the data

        -   Conduct any clean up or transformations

        -   Visualize the data

    -   A key figure, well-labelled, with a clear caption, presenting the data visualization you will use to answer your research question. In most cases, you would have 1 figure per question.

    -   A simple 1-sentence conclusion. Don’t refer to your prediction – just give a clear, concise, specific conclusion from what you can observe in your figure

-   Discussion

    -   Was your hypothesis supported, undermined, or no determination?

    -   How have you updated your beliefs, and why?

        -   Believe in your hypothesis more?

        -   Believe in your hypothesis less?

        -   No change in your belief in your hypothesis, instead a change in your belief that the way you tried to answer the question is valid.
