# Introduction

This is an investigation into the CO~2~ emissions that agriculture produces in various regions of the world. The investigation focuses on the CO~2~ emissions from pesticides, packaging, retail, transportation, industrial processes and product use. The question this investigation is trying to answer is: Do the added on 'ingredients', such as pesticides, industrial processes, packaging and food retail including transportation, contribute significantly to CO~2~ emissions?

This question is important to me to answer because I have a strong interest in our food processes and consumption habits. Much of the produce and food processed and not sold at retail stores are thrown away. Impurities and imperfections on produce can deem them unfit for the retail market, and then they are disposed of. We must acknowledge the processes that is being used to processes and grow these food and the emissions that is being developed by them. In a capitalist society, disposal of fresh

-   does the production of co2 pesticides contribute overall to the contribution of co2 in the environment

    these questions are important to me because i have always been interested in our food processes and consumption habits. How is it many people are actively and unknowingly throwing away their food and it has become a comodity while other poeple are barely able to find a decent meal to live off of.

-   Predictions: Give your prediction for your question. The question is still general, but the prediction should have some specificity about direction (positive or negative relationship?) and magnitude (subtle, moderate, large). For example: *I predict that students who live on campus will report substantially more happiness than those who commute*.

    I predit that these "added on" processes do significantly add to the co2 emissions. think about washing pacakging, making the packaging, and disposal of "unfit food"

    # Methods

    ### Data source

    ### Packages used

    ### Approach

    -   Data set - Give more details about the data set:

        -   What is the source?

            the source is from the food and agriculture organization (FAO), and the intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC)

        -   How was the data collected?

            the data was collected from a dozen individual data sets from the FAO and IPCC.

        -   What are the variables included?

            savanna fires, forest fires, crop residues, rice cultivation, drained organic soils ( co2), pesticides manufacturing, food transport, forestland, net forest conversion, food household consumption, food retail, on-farm electricity use, food packaging, agrifood systems waste disposal, food processing, fertilizers manufacturing, ippu (Emissions from industrial processes and product use), manure applied to soils, manure management, fires in organic soils, fires in humid tropical forests, on-farm energy use, rural population, total population, total population - male, total population - female.

        -   how many records/rows/participants?

            236 unique geografical area.

        -   Any other relevant information

            -   DATA IS RECORDED IN KILOTONES (kt) 1 kt = 1000 kg

    -   Tools

        -   R and RStudio in Posit.Cloud

        -   GitHub

        # Predictions

        -   How, specifically, will you assess your question(s)? Take your general questions and rephrase them based on the variables in your dataset (*e.g.* *I will examine the correlation between aggregated-stress scores and the subjective-well-being scale*).

            I will examine the correlation between co2 emissions and the emission contributions from three factors, pesticides, industrial processes, packaging and food retail

        -   Repeat your predictions, but with more specificity (e.g. *I predict that residents will have at least 1 point higher median score on the subjective-well being score than commuters*).

        -   I predict that packaging and food retail will have more co2 emissions than, pesticides

    # Results

    -   Code - Show the code block you are using to:

        -   Retrieve/load the data

        -   Conduct any clean up or transformations

        -   Visualize the data

    -   A key figure, well-labelled, with a clear caption, presenting the data visualization you will use to answer your research question. In most cases, you would have 1 figure per question.

    -   A simple 1-sentence conclusion. Don’t refer to your prediction – just give a clear, concise, specific conclusion from what you can observe in your figure

    1\) As food was processed in some areas, the total emission were most likely to increase as well

    2\) There is a slight positive correlation between the manufactured pesticides used on the farms and the total co2 emissions it contirbutes to

    3\) there is a strong positive correlation between the industrial processes and product use emissions and the total emissions that a region develops.

    # Discussion

    -   Was your hypothesis supported, undermined, or no determination?

        -   my hypothesis was supported (1), food processing emissions do contribute strongly and somewhat significantly to a region's total co2 emissions

            my hypothesis was undermined , a bit,(2), pesticides do not contribute strongly to the co2 emissions that a region contributes total, it still contributes somewhat to the total emissions, but there is many regions that hardly use pesticides and their contribution is close to none, there are also some regions that pesticides contribute

            my hypothesis was supported (3), industrial processes and product use emissions contribute strongly to the co2 emissions that a region contributes total

        -   How have you updated your beliefs, and why?

            -   Believe in your hypothesis more?

            -   Believe in your hypothesis less?

            -   No change in your belief in your hypothesis, instead a change in your belief that the way you tried to answer the question is valid
