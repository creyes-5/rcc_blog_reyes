# Introduction

This is an investigation into the CO~2~ emissions that agriculture produces in various regions of the world. The investigation focuses on the CO~2~ emissions from pesticides, packaging, retail, transportation, industrial processes and product use. The question this investigation is trying to answer is: Do the added on "ingredients", such as pesticides, industrial processes, packaging and food retail including transportation, contribute significantly to CO~2~ emissions?

This question is important to me to answer because I have a strong interest in our food processes and consumption habits. Much of the produce and food processed and not sold at retail stores are thrown away. Impurities and imperfections on produce can deem them unfit for the retail market, and then they are disposed of. We must acknowledge the processes that is being used to processes and grow these food and the emissions that is being developed by them. In a capitalist society, disposal of fresh usable produces has become normal. We must be be conscious of our spending habits, processing habits, and just how much resources we use subconsciously.

I predict that these added-on "ingredients" to our produce and agriculture processes, do significantly add to the produced CO~2~ emissions from agricultural sites. Everything from pesticides, washing, packaging, processing, and disposal of "unfit" produce can and will add on the CO~2~ emissions. Food retail, transportation and disposal do add on to the emissions as well.

# Methods

### Data source

My data source is from Kaggle.com, "Agri-food CO~2~ emission dataset - Forecasting ML" by Alessandro Lo Bello.

-   data set:

    <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessandrolobello/agri-food-co2-emission-dataset-forecasting-ml>

### Packages used

I used theses packages in my approach:

```{r}
#| label: libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
```

### Approach

-   Data set - Give more details about the data set:

    -   What is the source?

        The source was constructed by merging dozens of data sets from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (Bello, 2023).

    -   How was the data collected?

        The data was collected from a dozen individual data sets from the FAO and IPCC. They were cleaned, preprocessed, and merged together to create a "comprehensive and cohesive" data set (Bello, 2023).

    -   What are the variables included?

        The variables included are: savanna fires, forest fires, crop residues, rice cultivation, drained organic soils (CO~2~), pesticides manufacturing, food transport, forestland, net forest conversion, food household consumption, food retail, on-farm electricity use, food packaging, agrifood systems waste disposal, food processing, fertilizers manufacturing, IPPU (Emissions from industrial processes and product use), manure applied to soils, manure management, fires in organic soils, fires in humid tropical forests, on-farm energy use, rural population, total population, total population - male, total population - female and total emission.

        From these variables, I choose pesticides manufacturing, food transport, food retail, food packaging, food processing, IPPU and total emission.

    -   How many records/rows/participants?

        There were 236 unique geographical records and areas.

    -   Any other relevant information

        Emissions are recorded in Kilotons (kt) 1 kt = 1000 kg

        Added a decade variable to see if there is any correlation between the emissions and the years that the data was recorded.

-   Tools

    -   R and RStudio in Posit.Cloud

    -   GitHub

# Predictions

-   I will examine the correlation between the total CO~2~ emissions an agricultural site gives off and the emissions from three factors, pesticides, industrial processes and the process to make the produce ready for retail consumption. In the factor "retail ready" emissions I will be including the emissions from, food transport, food packaging, retail, and food processing.

-   I predict that the emissions from getting produce "retail ready" will contribute at least 50% of the total emissions produced by a specific site. I predict that many areas do use pesticides in their production and the areas that do will have 50% of their total emissions contributed from this. I predict that not many areas use industrial processes, but the areas that do have a lot of their emissions contributed from this. than, pesticides

# Results

-   Code -

    The code I used to retrieve, clean up and transform the data:

    ```{r}
    #| label: Retrieving, cleaning, transforming the Data

    # Retrieving
    foodAgro <- read.csv("Agrofood_co2_emission.csv") 

    # Cleaning 
    foodAgro2 <- foodAgro |>
      group_by(Area) |> 
      summarise(Year, 
          Area,
          total_emission, 
          Pesticides.Manufacturing, 
          IPPU, Food.Transport, 
          Food.Retail, 
          Food.Processing, 
          Food.Packaging) |>
      # Transforming
      mutate(retail.ready.emissions = 
              Food.Transport 
            + Food.Retail
            + Food.Packaging 
            + Food.Processing)

    # Transforming, adding a decade variable
    foodAgro2$decade <- "1990s"
    foodAgro2[foodAgro2$Year > 1999, ]$decade <- "2000s"
    foodAgro2[foodAgro2$Year > 2009, ]$decade <- "2010s"
    foodAgro2[foodAgro2$Year > 2019, ]$decade <- "2020s"
    ```

    # Visualizing the data:

    ```{r}
    #| label: Plot 1

    #food ready emiss v total emiss
    ggplot(data = foodAgro2, mapping = aes(x = retail.ready.emissions, y = total_emission)) + 
      geom_point(alpha = .5, mapping = aes(color = decade)) + 
      labs(title = "Food Processing and Transportation Emissions by Decades", 
           x = "Food Processing Emissions (kt)", 
           y = "Total Emissions (kt)") + 
      geom_smooth(se = FALSE)

    ```

    ### Conclusion:

    There is a strong relationship between the emissions in food processing and the total emissions given from an agricultural area. Food processing contributes about 20% of the total emissions for a given region.

    ```{r}
    #| label: Plot 2

    # Pesticides vs Total Emissions
    ggplot(data = foodAgro2, mapping = aes(x = Pesticides.Manufacturing, y = total_emission)) + 
      geom_point(alpha = .5, mapping = aes(color = decade)) + 
      labs(title = "Pesticides Manufacturing Emissions by Decades", 
           x = "Pesticides Manufacturing Emissions (kt)", 
           y = "Total Emissions (kt)") + 
      geom_smooth(se = FALSE)

    ```

    ### Conclusion:

    In pesticide manufacturing, there is not a very strong relationship between pesticides and the CO~2~ emitted from a particular region. Less than one percent of the emissions from pesticides manufacturing contributes to the total emissions from a particular region.

    ```{r}
    #| label: Plot 3

    # IPPU (Emissions from industrial processes and product use) v total emiss
    ggplot(data = foodAgro2, mapping = aes(x = IPPU, y = total_emission)) + 
      geom_point(alpha = .5, mapping = aes(color = decade)) + 
      labs(title = "Industrial Processes and Product Use Emissions by Decades", 
            x = "Industrial Processes and Product Use Emissions (kt)", 
            y = "Total Emissions (kt)") + 
      geom_smooth(se = FALSE)

    ```

    ### Conclusion:

    There is a very strong correlation between the industrial processes and product use emissions and total emissions that a region emits. Almost half the total emissions from a agricultural site, is contributed by the industrial processes and the product use emissions.

# Discussion

-   My first hypothesis was supported, food processing emissions do contribute strongly and somewhat significantly to a region's total CO~2~ emissions. Much of the data set were in fact grouped in the little to no emissions contributed. I did have data from many regions of the world including 1st or 3rd world regions. Many regions do not completely process their food in industrial factories or warehouses. The areas that do process their food, about 20% of their total emissions are contributed from the processing emissions.

-   My second hypothesis was undermined, pesticides manufacturing emissions do not contribute significantly to the total emissions of a given area. It is import to look at the axes that the plot gave. Many of the points are scattered around the graph, not showing any strong correlation between the two factors. There are many countries who use little to no pesticides, giving little to no emissions. The areas and regions who do use pesticides, the pesticides only make less than one percent of the total emissions for that region.

-   My third hypothesis was supported, industrial processes and product use contribute about half the total emissions from a particular region. Now there are many more points who emit CO~2~ emissions related to the industrial processes and product use. These "retail-ready" produce must undergo various packaging, washing, transportation and disposing processes to deliver the best produce to the retail stores, which will contribute significantly to the total CO~2~ emissions from a particular region.
